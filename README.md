## User Cases

1.  I picture this app being used by some users who love music, especially live music and want to keep track of when their favorite artists are coming to their city.
2.  The second would be for those who would like to use the app as a way to search artists and link to their Songkick pages.
3.  Lastly I think this app could be fun for those who are just looking to have an easy way to purchase tickets via Songkick links for each search result.
